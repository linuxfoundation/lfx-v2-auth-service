# LFX V2 Auth Service

This repository contains the source code for the LFX v2 platform authentication service.

## Overview

The LFX v2 Auth Service provides authentication and profile access in the v2 Platform, serving as an abstraction layer between applications and identity providers (Auth0 and Authelia). This service enables user management, profile updates, email/social account linking, and user discovery while maintaining compatibility across different deployment environments.

The service operates as a NATS-based microservice, responding to request/response patterns on specific subjects.

## Releases

### Creating a Release

To create a new release of the auth service:

1. **Update the chart version** in `charts/lfx-v2-auth-service/Chart.yaml` prior to any project releases, or if any
   change is made to the chart manifests or configuration:
   ```yaml
   version: 0.2.0  # Increment this version
   appVersion: "latest"  # Keep this as "latest"
   ```

2. **After the pull request is merged**, create a GitHub release and choose the
   option for GitHub to also tag the repository. The tag must follow the format
   `v{version}` (e.g., `v0.2.0`). This tag does _not_ have to match the chart
   version: it is the version for the project release, which will dynamically
   update the `appVersion` in the released chart.

3. **The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically**:
   - Build and publish the container images (auth-service)
   - Package and publish the Helm chart to GitHub Pages
   - Publish the chart to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR)
   - Sign the chart with Cosign
   - Generate SLSA provenance

### Important Notes

- The `appVersion` in `Chart.yaml` should always remain `"latest"` in the committed code.
- During the release process, the `ko-build-tag.yaml` workflow automatically overrides the `appVersion` with the actual tag version (e.g., `v0.2.0` becomes `0.2.0`).
- Only update the chart `version` field when making releases - this represents the Helm chart version.
- The container image tags are automatically managed by the consolidated CI/CD pipeline using the git tag.
- Both container images (auth-service) and the Helm chart are published together in a single workflow.
