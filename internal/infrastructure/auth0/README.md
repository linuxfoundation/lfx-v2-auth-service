# Auth0 Integration

This package provides Auth0 integration for the LFX v2 Auth Service, implementing user management operations through the Auth0 Management API.

## Overview

The Auth0 integration supports two primary lookup strategies for user metadata retrieval, providing both authoritative identification and convenient username-based searches.

## User Identification Strategies

### Canonical Lookup Strategy (Recommended)

**Format:** `<connection>|<provider_user_id>`

The canonical lookup is the **authoritative, standard way to identify a user**, regardless of which provider they come from. The sub (subject) identifier is the authoritative identifier that uniquely identifies a user across the entire Auth0 tenant.

**Examples:**
* `auth0|123456789` — Auth0 Database connection user
* `google-oauth2|987654321` — Google OAuth2 user
* `github|456789123` — GitHub OAuth2 user
* `samlp|enterprise|user123` — SAML Enterprise connection user
* `linkedin|789123456` — LinkedIn OAuth2 user

**Auth0 Management API Call:**
```
GET /api/v2/users/{sub}
```

**Benefits:**
- **Authoritative**: Guaranteed unique identifier across all connections
- **Fast**: Direct lookup by primary key
- **Reliable**: No ambiguity about which user is being referenced
- **Cross-provider**: Works regardless of authentication provider

### Search Lookup Strategy (Convenience)

**Format:** `<username>`

Username lookups are **convenience only** and help avoid connection collisions. This strategy searches for users by their username within the Username-Password-Authentication connection.

**Examples:**
- `john.doe`
- `jane.smith`
- `developer123`

**Auth0 Management API Call:**
```
GET /api/v2/users?q=identities.user_id:{username} AND identities.connection:Username-Password-Authentication
```

**Limitations:**
- **Connection-specific**: Only works within Username-Password-Authentication connection
- **Slower**: Requires search query instead of direct lookup
- **Limited scope**: Cannot find users from social or enterprise connections
