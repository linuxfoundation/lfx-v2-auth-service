# Authelia Integration

This package provides integration between the LFX v2 Auth Service and Authelia, a modern authentication and authorization server. The integration enables local development environments to use Authelia as an identity provider while maintaining user data persistence through NATS Key-Value store.

## Architecture Overview

The Authelia integration consists of several key components:

- **NATS KV Storage**: Persistent storage for user data using NATS Key-Value store
- **Kubernetes Orchestrator**: Manages Authelia ConfigMaps, Secrets, and DaemonSet restarts
- **Sync Engine**: Synchronizes user data between NATS KV and Authelia's Kubernetes resources (currently runs only at auth-service startup; future versions will watch for NATS KV changes)

## Token Support

The Authelia integration takes an opaque token and validates/retrieves user data from the Authelia identity provider. The system uses the opaque token to authenticate with Authelia's OIDC UserInfo endpoint and extract user identification information.

### Opaque Token Processing

**Token Format:** Opaque tokens issued by Authelia

**Token Structure:**
```
authelia_at_Tx****
```

### Token Processing Flow

1. **Token Validation**: Validates the opaque token with Authelia's OIDC UserInfo endpoint
2. **UserInfo Retrieval**: Calls Authelia's `/api/oidc/userinfo` endpoint with the token
3. **Sub Extraction**: Extracts the `sub` (subject) claim from the UserInfo response
4. **User Lookup**: Uses the extracted `sub` value for user data retrieval
5. **User Data Retrieval**: Returns user metadata from Authelia

### Authelia OIDC Integration

**UserInfo Endpoint:**
```http
GET /api/oidc/userinfo
Authorization: Bearer {opaque_token}
```

**UserInfo Response:**
```json
{
  "sub": "550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000",
  "name": "John Doe",
  "email": "john.doe@example.com"
}
```

### Important Notes

- **Opaque Token Validation**: Full token validation is performed with Authelia's OIDC UserInfo endpoint
- **Token Expiration**: Opaque tokens are validated for expiration and freshness by Authelia
- **Production Ready**: This implementation includes proper security measures for production use
- **Authelia OIDC**: Uses Authelia's OIDC UserInfo endpoint for user data retrieval
- **SUB Management**: The `sub` claim is deterministically generated by Authelia and used for user identification

## Components

### Storage Layer (`storage.go`)
- Implements NATS Key-Value store for persistent user data
- Provides CRUD operations for Authelia user records
- Maintains user data in JSON format within NATS KV buckets

### Orchestrator Layer (`orchestrator.go`)
- Manages Kubernetes resources (ConfigMaps, Secrets, DaemonSets)
- Updates Authelia configuration when user data changes
- Handles DaemonSet restarts to apply configuration changes

### Sync Engine (`sync.go`)
- Compares user data between NATS KV storage and Kubernetes ConfigMaps
- Determines required actions (create, update, or no action needed)
- Orchestrates updates to maintain consistency between storage and runtime configuration

### User Management (`user.go`)
- Provides high-level user operations (get, update, search)
- Integrates with the sync engine to ensure data consistency
- Implements the domain port interfaces for user management

## Sync Flow

The synchronization process ensures that user data stored in NATS KV is properly reflected in Authelia's runtime configuration:

1. **Load Phase**: Retrieves user data from both NATS KV storage and Kubernetes ConfigMaps
2. **Compare Phase**: Identifies differences between storage and orchestrator data
3. **Sync Phase**: Updates storage and/or orchestrator based on identified differences
4. **Restart Phase**: Restarts Authelia DaemonSet when configuration changes are made

### Sequence Diagram

The following sequence diagram illustrates the synchronization process between NATS KV storage and Authelia's Kubernetes resources:

    participant AS as Auth Service
    participant NK as NATS KV Store
    participant CM as ConfigMap
    participant SEC as Secrets
    participant DS as DaemonSet
    participant A as Authelia Pod

    Note over AS: Service Startup / User Update
    
    AS->>NK: Load users from NATS KV
    AS->>CM: Load users from ConfigMap
    
    Note over AS: Compare Phase
    AS->>AS: Compare users between storage and orchestrator
    AS->>AS: Determine required actions
    
    alt User needs storage creation
        AS->>NK: Create/Update user in NATS KV
    end
    
    alt User needs orchestrator update
        AS->>AS: Generate new password pair (plain + bcrypt)
        AS->>NK: Update user with bcrypt hash
        AS->>CM: Update ConfigMap with user config (YAML)
        AS->>SEC: Update Secret with plain password
        AS->>DS: Restart DaemonSet (add restart annotation)
        DS->>A: Rolling restart Authelia pods
        A->>A: Load new configuration from ConfigMap
        A->>A: Access passwords from Secret
    end
    
    Note over A: Authelia ready with updated user data
```

### Sync Actions

- **Storage Creation**: User exists in orchestrator but not in storage - user is added to NATS KV
- **Orchestrator Creation**: User exists in storage but not in orchestrator - ConfigMap and Secrets are updated
- **Orchestrator Update**: User exists in both but has different password or email - ConfigMap and Secrets are updated
- **No Action**: User data is consistent between storage and orchestrator

## Configuration

The Authelia integration requires the following configuration parameters:

### Kubernetes Configuration
- `namespace`: Kubernetes namespace where Authelia resources are deployed
- `configmap-name`: Name of the ConfigMap containing Authelia user configuration
- `daemon-set-name`: Name of the Authelia DaemonSet to restart when needed
- `secret-name`: Name of the Secret containing user passwords

### NATS Configuration
- NATS server connection details (inherited from main service configuration)
- Key-Value bucket configuration for user data storage

## Subject Identifier (SUB) Management

### SUB Generation and Persistence

The Subject Identifier (SUB) in Authelia is a deterministic UUID that uniquely identifies each user within the system. Key characteristics:

- **Deterministic Generation**: The SUB is a UUID that is deterministically generated from the username by Authelia
- **No Provider Prefix**: Unlike Auth0 (which uses formats like `auth0|123456789`), Authelia SUBs are pure UUIDs without any provider prefix (e.g., `550e8400-e29b-41d4-a716-446655440000`)
- **Username-Based**: The SUB is consistently derived from the username, ensuring the same username always produces the same SUB
- **Token-Based Persistence**: To ensure consistent data retrieval from Authelia, the SUB is only persisted when a user is updated using a valid authentication token
- **OIDC UserInfo Endpoint**: The SUB can be retrieved from Authelia's OIDC UserInfo endpoint at `/api/oidc/userinfo` using a valid token

### Token-Based User Updates

When updating user metadata through the auth service, the SUB is populated by accessing Authelia's UserInfo endpoint with the provided token:

```bash
# Example: Update user metadata with token (this populates the SUB)
nats req --server nats://lfx-platform-nats.lfx.svc.cluster.local:4222 "lfx.auth-service.user_metadata.update" '{
  "token": "authelia_at_Tx****",
  "user_metadata": {
    "city": "Metropolis"
  }
}'
```

This process ensures that:
- The SUB is retrieved from Authelia's authoritative source
- User data consistency is maintained across the system
- The canonical user identifier is properly established for future lookups

## Security Considerations

- User passwords are automatically generated and stored as bcrypt hashes in ConfigMaps
- Plain text passwords are stored separately in Kubernetes Secrets for Authelia access
- All password generation uses cryptographically secure random generation
- Kubernetes RBAC controls access to ConfigMaps and Secrets

## Development Usage

When running in local development mode with Authelia:

1. Ensure Kubernetes cluster is available (local or remote)
2. Deploy Authelia using the LFX v2 platform Helm charts: [lfx-v2-helm/charts/lfx-platform/templates/authelia](https://github.com/linuxfoundation/lfx-v2-helm/tree/main/charts/lfx-platform/templates/authelia)
3. Configure the auth-service with proper Kubernetes credentials and resource names
4. The service will automatically sync user data and restart Authelia when needed

## Error Handling

The integration includes comprehensive error handling for:
- Kubernetes API failures
- NATS KV storage issues
- Configuration validation errors
- Sync operation failures

All errors are logged with appropriate context and returned as structured error types for proper handling by the calling application.
